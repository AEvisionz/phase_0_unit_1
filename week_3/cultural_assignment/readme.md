# U1, W1: Cultural Assignment

## Background



## Directions

First, create a new file in this directory from the command line. Navigate to the `cultural_assignment` directory. Then create a new file by typing `touch biggest_fear.html`. 

Open that file in sublime by typing `subl biggest_fear.html`. If you do not have the subl command set up, read <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html" target="_blank"> Sublime Text Command Line Documentation</a> to set it up. 

Once you've opened your file, write a response to the prompt using the HTML you've learned to set up the file: 

#### TOPIC

***

#### What to submit: 
There is no length requirement, but we want you to be open to sharing your fears. 

When you finish writing your response, save your changes locally. Then navigate to your terminal (HINT: If you are using a mac, you can hold down command and tab to navigate to open programs. Use arrows or continue clicking tab until you get to the terminal).
