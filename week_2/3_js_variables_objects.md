# U1.W2: JavaScript Variables and Object Types


## Learning Objectives
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create objects of different types in JavaScript
3. Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
4. Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Background
Now that you have had a bit of fun with JavaScript in the [Code Combat](2_code_combat.md) 
challenge, you will want to learn a bit more about how JavaScript works. Before working 
on this challenge, read through [object_types](reading_material/object_types.md) and 
[JavaScript Intro](reading_material/javascript_intro_lab). Make sure to practice as 
you go. You can open a new sublime file and run it in your terminal with node.js. 
This will help to solidify your knowledge. By the way, this would be a cool thing to pair on. 
If you read with your pair and practice as you go, you may learn the concepts a bit better.  

In this challenge you will be creating a series of variables. The values of the variables 
will be different types of JavaScript objects.

Below you will find driver code. Run the code in this file either from the command line 
using Node.js or by pasting the code of this entire file into your browser console. All tests will log `true` in the console when they pass--`false`, otherwise.

The tests will tell you what to do next.  Run the code and read the message explaining 
why the code couldn't be run or why the test failed.  The first step is going be to make 
the first test pass.  Then make the second test pass, and so on.

Hint: If you get an error message that says something like ...

`ReferenceError: secretNumber is not defined`, try declaring a variable with that name (e.g., `secretNumber`).

## Directions
**Fork [this gist](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/78460da2eb191d62f0c5).** *Remember to click the link before forking.*

You can either copy the text into a sublime file, or you can use the command line to clone the gist into a directory (if you have git commands set up). Make changes in your local file, and copy and paste them into your copy of the gist (in your GitHub account). 


###1. Test-Driven Development
This is your first introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD). In this challenge, you will be dependent upon the provided driver code to guide your coding. Read [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) to learn more about TDD if you're interested. 

First run the code and read the error message, then hypothesize about what you need to write to fix it.

###2. Pseudocode
Write specific and write step-by-step ideas to pass each test in code-like English. Each line should be something you can easily translate into code. For help with writing pseudocode, take a look at this [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html) example. 


###3. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. If you are missing a step, be sure to add it to your pseudocode and then try to implement it. When your code passes the test, move on to the next test. 

###4. Refactor
When all the error messages are passing, go back and check each solution. Ask yourself:
- Are the variable names you've chosen clear? (see [Tips for Naming Variables](http://www.makinggoodsoftware.com/2009/05/04/71-tips-for-naming-variables/))
- Is the code concise (but readable)? See [JavaScript: Condensed Code vs. Readability](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-short-code) *Don't expect yourself to understand each part of the JavaScript, rather, compare the examples*  
- Is the code [D.R.Y](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don't_Repeat_Yourself)? 

If you can't think of a way to improve your code, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank.

###5. Edit your forked gist
Now that you've done all this work, don't forget to upload it to your gist! Log in to [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com). Click on the `p0_u1_w2_javascript_objects.js` file in your gists. At the top you should see the "edit" button. Click it. Make sure to copy and paste your final solution in the gist. (If you need to make updates later, you can do so easily by clicking "edit" again). 

Make sure to edit line 1 to reflect whether you worked on the challenge on your own or with a pair. If you worked with a pair, make sure to put his/her name!

## Reflect
In the reflection section of the gist, reflect on your learning. Use the [reflection guidelines](reflection_guidelines) to guide your reflection. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!***

## Review others' Reflections
Go to the [original gist](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/78460da2eb191d62f0c5). On the left side, under "Gist Detail", click on "Forks." 

Read two other students' pseudocode and reflections. Ask yourself:
- How was their pseudocode? 
- Was the pseudocode detailed enough that you would be able to implement it easily? 
- Was the pseudocode verbose? Was it clear? 
- Did they struggle with the same concepts according to their reflection?
- Were you able to tell how they worked through the challenge?

Leave a comment telling them what they did well and can do better next time with regard to the pseudocode and reflection. Be kind, specific and actionable. (You are expected to leave at least two comments for this challenge). *NOTE: Forks will only appear when at least one fork has been created.*
