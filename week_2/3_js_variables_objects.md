# U1.W2: JavaScript Variables and Object Types


## Learning Objectives
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create objects of different types in JavaScript
3. Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
4. Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Directions
Now that you have had a bit of fun with JavaScript in the [Code Combat](2_code_combat.md) challenge, you will want to learn a bit more about what JavaScript is and how it works. This challenge requires you to define JavaScript variables. The variables will be assigned different types of objects as values. Before working on this challenge, read through [object_types](reading_material/object_types.md) and [JavaScript Intro](reading_material/javascript_intro_lab)

###1. Test-Driven Development
This is your first introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD). In this challenge, you will be dependent upon the provided driver code to guide your coding. Read [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) to learn more about TDD. 

First run the code and read the error message, then hypothesize about what you need to write to fix it.

###2. Pseudocode
Write your idea to pass the test in English. Make sure to be specific and write step-by-step instructions. Each line should be something you can easily translate into code. For help with writing pseuddocode, take a look at an example of a [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html). 


###3. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. See if the tests pass. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. If you are missing a step, be sure to add it to your pseudocode and then try to implement it. 

###4. Refactor
When you get to the point that all the error messages are passing, go back and check that you've written each solution concisely. Some things to look for:
- Are the variable names you've chosen clear? (see [Tips for Naming Variables](http://www.makinggoodsoftware.com/2009/05/04/71-tips-for-naming-variables/)
- Is the code concise (but readable)? See [JavaScript: Condensed Code vs. Readability](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-short-code) *Don't expect yourself to understand each part of the JavaScript, rather, compare the examples*  
- Is the code [D.R.Y](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don't_Repeat_Yourself)? 

If you think of a way to improve your code through refactoring, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank, you need to justify the omission of refactoring.

###5. Reflect
In your week 2 reflection gist (which you have already forked into your account), answer the questions and reflect on your learning in this challenge. Make sure to address the learning objectives in your reflection.
