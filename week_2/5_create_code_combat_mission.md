## Directions

This is the process you should complete every time you work on a challenge. First read, then create pseudocode, write a solution, make it pass the tests, refactor the code, then reflect. 

###1. Pseudocode
List out the steps you need to complete to complete the challenge.  Write these in plain english and save them as comments. 

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

###2. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. 


Once your code produces your expected output, save your file, add it to your stage, and commit your changes. 

###3. Refactored Solution
Read through your solution. Is the naming clear? Is the code concise (but readable)? Are you repeating yourself? Is everything necessary? 

Remember: great code is rarely the fewest number of characters or lines, it's about how readable, extendable, and reusable it is.

If you can't figure out how to refactor your initial solution, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank, you need to justify your omission.

###4. Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?



###5. Review another person's solution and leave a comment!
