## Learning Objectives
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Define functions in JavaScript
3. Create, add elements to, access, and iterate over arrays in JavaScript
4. Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values in object literals


## Directions

## Learning Outcomes
- work with JavaScript object literals
    - create an object
    - add properties to an object
    - access values of object properties
- use pre-written tests to drive development


For this challenge, assume there is a teacher with a list of students and a list of their respective test scores.  The teacher is providing you with this data which looks like ...

```javascript
var students = ["Joseph", "Susan", "William", "Elizabeth"]

var scores = [ [80, 70, 70, 100],
               [85, 80, 90, 90],
               [75, 70, 80, 75],
               [100, 90, 95, 85] ]
```


You will take this data and transform it into a grade book.  The grade book will be a JavaScript Object object.

The gist provides you with driver code: 9 tests for your code to pass.  The gist also provides 9 steps that direct you through completing the challenge.  You can think of the steps as ready-made pseudocode.



## Optimize your learning 
Once you've made all 9 tests pass, take a look at your code.  Is it readable?  Could it be simplified?  Refactor as appropriate.



## Helpful Resources
* JavaScript: [Object Syntax](http://www.sitepoint.com/back-to-basics-javascript-object-syntax/)
* Socrates JavaScript Labs: [Looping](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/labs/javascript/loops/looping-basics)

This is the process you should complete every time you work on a challenge. First read, then create pseudocode, write a solution, make it pass the tests, refactor the code, then reflect.

###1) Pseudocode
List out the steps you need to complete to complete the challenge.  Write these in plain english and save them as comments. 

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

###2) Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. 


Once your code produces your expected output, save your file, add it to your stage, and commit your changes. 


<!--###4) Review and Create Tests
Click on the "See Specs" button in the exercise, and review the rspec tests that you just passed. 
-->
###3) Refactored Solution
Read through your solution. Is the naming clear? Is the code concise (but readable)? Are you repeating yourself? Is everything necessary? 

Remember: great code is rarely the fewest number of characters or lines, it's about how readable, extendable, and reusable it is.

If you can't figure out how to refactor your initial solution, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank, you need to justify your omission.

###4) Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
