# U1.W2: JavaScript Variables and Object Types


## Learning Objectives
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create objects of different types in JavaScript
3. Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
4. Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Directions
This challenge requires you to define JavaScript variables. The variables will be assigned different types of objects as values. Before working on this challenge, make sure you read through this week's [reading material](reading_material)

###1. Test-Driven Development
This is your first introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD). In this challenge, you will be dependent upon the provided driver code to guide your coding. Read [The Newbie's Guide to Test-Driven Development](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-newbies-guide-to-test-driven-development--net-13835) to learn more about TDD. 

First run the code and read the error message, then hypothesize about what you need to write to fix it.

###2. Pseudocode
Write your idea to pass the test in English. Make sure to be specific and write step-by-step instructions. Each line should be something you can easily translate into code. For help with writing pseuddocode, take a look at an example of a [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html). 


###2. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. See if the tests pass. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. If you are missing a step, be sure to add it to your pseudocode and then try to implement it. 


###3. Reflect
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?


###5. Review another person's solution and leave a comment!
