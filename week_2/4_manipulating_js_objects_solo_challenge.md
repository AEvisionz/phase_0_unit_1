# U1.W2: Manipulating JavaScript Objects Solo Challenge

**This is a solo challenge. Refer to the [solo challenge](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/solo_challenges.md) guidelines in the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/).

## Learning Objectives
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values from JavaScript Object literals
3. Use pre-written tests to drive development


## Directions
This is the process you should go through every time you work on a challenge.

1. Run the tests
2. Write pseudocode
3. Create a passing solution
4. Refactor
5. Reflect 

To begin, fork [this gist](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/dcc6510f8a7030e8ac54) into your GitHub account.


In this challenge you will work with the following JavaScript object that has been assigned to the variable terah.

```javascript
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
```

You will find driver code in the gist you forked. Run the code either
from the command line using Node.js or by pasting the code of this
entire file into your browser console.  All tests will log 'true'
in the console when they pass--false, otherwise.

Follow the steps below to make the tests pass and complete the challenge.  
The order of the steps corresponds to the order of the tests.  After completing 
each step, run your code to be certain that the next test has passed.

When all of the tests have passed, your final terah object will be logged to the console.


1. Define a variable adam and use object literal notation to assign this variable 
   the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties.

2. Give adam a name property with the value "Adam".

3. Add a spouse property to terah and assign it the value of adam.

4. Change the value of the terah weight property to 125.

5. Remove the eyeColor property from terah.

6. Add a spouse property to adam and assign it the value of terah.

7. Add a children property to terah and and use object literal notation to assign 
   this variable the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties

8. Add a carson property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
  the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carson".

9. Add a carter property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
   the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carter".

10. Add a colton property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
    the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Colton".

11. Add a children property to adam and assign it the value of terah children.



###1. Pseudocode
After you run the file, write pseudocode for solving that passing that test in the pseudocode section of the gist. Write these using the tips in calpoly's [pseudocode standard](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/pdl_std.html).
Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

###2. Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code until the test passes. Then move on to the next test.

###3. Refactored Solution


###4. Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?



###5. Review another person's solution and leave a comment!
