# U1.W2: JavaScript Variables and Object Types


## Learning Objectives
1. Define local variables in JavaScript
2. Create objects of different types in JavaScript
3. Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
4. Use pre-written tests to drive development


This challenge requires you to define JavaScript variables. The variables will be assigned different types of objects as values. Before working on this challenge, make sure you read through this week's <a href="" target="_blank">reading material</a>

###1) Read the Errors
You will be dependent upon the provided driver code to guide your development. First run the code and read the error message, then hypothesize about what you could do to fix the problem. This is your first introduction to test-driven development. 

###2) Pseudocode
Pseudocode what you need to do to make each test pass in English. Make sure you write this out. 

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

###2) Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code to make the tests pass. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. 


###3) Refactored Solution
When you get to the point that all the error messages are passing, go back and check that you've written each solution concisely. 

Are the names clear? Is the code concise (but readable)? Are you repeating yourself? Is everything you included necessary? 

If you can't figure out how to refactor your initial solution, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank, you need to justify your omission.

###4) Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?


###5) Review another person's solution and leave a comment!
