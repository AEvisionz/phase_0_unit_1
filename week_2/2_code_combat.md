# U1.W2: Code Combat's Beginner Campaign


## Learning Objectives
1. Manipulate an object using JavaScript
2. Explain what `()` does in JavaScript
3. Use appropriate JavaScript syntax


## Directions
Visit [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/play) and complete each of the missions in the beginner campaign using the steps below. These directions might seem tedious for something so simple, but it's important to get in the habit of going through these steps.  

Go to the original challenge gist [p0_u1_w2_code_combat.js](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/4adf058ea4dffa667b16) and fork it into your account. For each mission, you need to go through parts 1 and 2. This is a mostly empty gist, so please write the title of each mission (as a comment) as you go. You need to pseudocode and create a solution for each mission. 
 
###1. Pseudocode 
Write simple pseudocode for each challenge. For example, write something like:

```javascript
// move right x2
// move up 1x
// ATTACK!
```  

###2. Initial Solution
Translate your pseudocode into code and see if it achieves the goals. If it doesn't quite work, modify it. Once you achieve each of the goals in each part, paste your successful code into your file. 

## Reflect
In your week 2 reflection gist (which you have already forked into your account), answer the questions and reflect on your learning in this challenge. Make sure to address the learning objectives in your reflection.
