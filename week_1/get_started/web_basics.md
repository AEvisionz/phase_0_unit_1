### 2) Create a web page

Now let's put that knowledge to work!  We will be using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as our [text editor](http://skillcrush.com/2012/09/10/text-editor/).  Review the [Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course--net-27293) if you need a refreshed on how to write code using Sublime.

* **Open a new file in Sublime**
* Save the file as `index.html` in the **same directory as your copy of [USERNAME].github.io**<br /><br />![Sublime save](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/get_started/imgs/sublime-save.jpg)
* Add the following **HTML code** to your file:<br />`<html><body>Hello DBC!</body></html>`
* **Save the file**

### 3) Save your page to Github

If you are **NOT** using Mac or Windows and the Github App, [follow this tutorial](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2#awesm=~oxToOt4ihQmVCP) and then skip to #5.

* **Open the Github App**<ul><li>You should be in your [USERNAME]/[USERNAME].github.io repository</li><li>You should be in the "Changes" view</li><li>You should see `index.html` in the list of changes as a new file</li></ul>![Github app new change](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/get_started/imgs/github-app-2_save-1.jpg)
* **Type a "commit message"**<br><br>A commit message is a desscription of all the files and changes that are part of the "snapshot" (or commit) you are about to save.  If another programmer read just the commit, they should understand what changed (or was added or deleted) and why.<br><br>![Github commit](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/get_started/imgs/github-app-2_save-2.jpg)
* **Click on the "Commit" button**<br>*If you get an alert about saving credentials, choose "Always Allow"*
* **View your commit**<ul><li>Click on "History" in the left sidebar</li><li>History shows all the commits anyone has made</li><li>It's kind of awesome</li></ul><br><br>![Github commit](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/get_started/imgs/github-app-2_save-3.jpg)


### 4) Push your page to Github

Click on the **Sync Branch** button in the upper right corner.

### 5) View your site

It's now time for the big reveal!! 

Go to **http://[USERNAME].github.io** to see your HTML page live!

You can also see the new index.html file in your Github repository!
