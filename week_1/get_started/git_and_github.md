# Git and Github 

* [Setup](#setup)
* [Learn](#learn)

## Setup

Have you signed up for [Github](http://www.github.com) yet? If not, [sign up here](https://github.com/).

You'll need to [install git and set up SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) (authentication for Github). 

### Your Username

You need to know your Github username.  When you see "[USERNAME]" in this guide, you'll replace it with your username.

My username is "rmw".  So "github.com/**[USERNAME]**" becomes "github.com/**rmw**".

### The Github App

Download the Github desktop application.

- [Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

*Note: if you are using Linux, you'll need to use the command line for Git. We will have instructions for this later.*
