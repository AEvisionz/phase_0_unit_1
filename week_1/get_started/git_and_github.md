# Git and Github 

## Learning Objectives

* Set up git on your computer
* Generate and install SSH keys on your computer
* Download the Github App
* Understand git, Github and version control


## Directions

### 1) Setup git and Github

Have you signed up for [Github](http://www.github.com) yet? If not, [sign up here](https://github.com/).

You'll need to [install git and set up SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) (authentication for Github). 

#### A) Your Username

You need to know your Github username.  When you see "[USERNAME]" in this guide, you'll replace it with your username.

My username is "rmw".  So "github.com/**[USERNAME]**" becomes "github.com/**rmw**".


#### B) Install the Github App

Download the Github desktop application.

- [Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

*Note: if you are using Linux, you'll need to use the command line for Git. We will have instructions for this later.*
