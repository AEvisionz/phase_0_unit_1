# Set up a repository

We are going to create a repository to host your very own website. You'll be using a Github repository and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to set up your website.

## Learning Objectives

* Create a repository on github
* Clone the repository to your local computer


## Directions


### 1) Create a website repository


1. **Log into [Github](http://www.github.com)**
2. **[Start a new repository](https://github.com/new)**<br /><br />This will take you to the new repository form.<br /><br />![New repo form](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/get_started/imgs/github-repo-1.jpg)
3. **Fill out the new repository form.** <ul><li>You *must, must, must* name your repository **[USERNAME].github.io**.</li><li>Your repository should be *public*.  </li><li>Check "Initialize this project with a README" and add an MIT license. You can read more about [Open Source](http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/29/open-source-software/) and [Open Source licensing here.](http://www.slideshare.net/CodeMontage/writespeakcode-open-source-licenses)</li></ul>![New repo form](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/get_started/imgs/github-repo-2.jpg)<br /><br />I'm gonna say it again: You *must, must, must* name your repository **[USERNAME].github.io**.
4. Click on the **"Create Repository" button**
4. **Do a celebration dance!** <br />:dancers: :tada: :dancer: <br /><br />![You have a repo](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/get_started/imgs/github-repo3.jpg)




### 2) Download the repository

A git repository is "distributed", which means it exists on many computers instead of just one.  Right now your repository exists on Github, but in order to add or edit files, you need it to exist on *your computer*.

In git terms, this is called **cloning a repository locally**. A "local repository" is the copy on your computer. A "remote repository" is one on another server, i.e. on Github, or on another person's computer.  

#### Clone a repository with the Github App

For [Mac](http://mac.github.com/) and [Windows](http://windows.github.com/) users, open the Github app you installed earlier.

If you are working on Linux and/or want to challenge yourself further, skip to the next section.

1. Open the Github App
2. On the right side bar, click on your github [USERNAME]
3. In the search bar, start searching for "github".  Your "[USERNAME].github.io" repository should come up in the list.
4. Click on the "Clone to this computer" button.

#### Cloning a repository with the command line

This section is for Linux users or those who want to challenge themselves.  Later in DBC and in your life as a professional developer, you will use git and access Github using the command line (aka "terminal").

[Use this tutorial to clone your repository on the command line](git_clone.md).
