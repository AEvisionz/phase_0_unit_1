## Release 1: Create a web page

Now let's put that knowledge to work!  We will be using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as our [text editor](http://skillcrush.com/2012/09/10/text-editor/).  Review the [Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course--net-27293) if you need a refresher on how to write code using Sublime.

* **Open a new file in Sublime**
* Save the file as `index.html` in the **same directory as your copy of [USERNAME].github.io**<br /><br />![Sublime save](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/1_Get_Started/imgs/sublime-save.jpg)
* Add the following **HTML code** to your file:<br />`<html><body>Hello DBC!</body></html>`
* **Save the file**

## Release 2: Save your page to GitHub

If you are **NOT** using Mac or Windows and the GitHub App, [follow this tutorial](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2#awesm=~oxToOt4ihQmVCP) and then skip to release 4.

* **Open the GitHub App**<ul><li>You should be in your [USERNAME]/[USERNAME].github.io repository</li><li>You should be in the "Changes" view</li><li>You should see `index.html` in the list of changes as a new file</li></ul>![GitHub app new change](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/1_Get_Started/imgs/github-app-2_save-1.jpg)
* **Type a "commit message"**<br><br>A commit message is a description of all the files and changes that are part of the "snapshot" (or commit) you are about to save.  If another programmer only read the commit, they should understand what was changed (or added or deleted) and why.<br><br>![GitHub commit](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/1_Get_Started/imgs/github-app-2_save-2.jpg)
* **Click on the "Commit" button**<br>*If you get an alert about saving credentials, choose "Always Allow"*
* **View your commit**<ul><li>Click on "History" in the left sidebar</li><li>History shows all the commits anyone has made</li><li>It's kind of awesome</li></ul><br><br>![GitHub commit](https://raw.github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/master/week_1/1_Get_Started/imgs/github-app-2_save-3.jpg)

## Release 5: Reflection

Now you will want to practice what you've learned in this challenge (and don't worry, you'll get to do this for the rest of phase 0).

In the GitHub app, go to your [USERNAME]/phase_0_unit_1 repository. Clone it to your computer. Then, open the terminal and navigate to that repository. Open the repository in Sublime. You can do this by either adding sublime shortcuts to your command line or opening sublime and opening the repository from there. 

You should edit all code, reflections, etc. from sublime. It's bad practice to make changes from github.com. (So forget we told you to do that in the past two challenges)! 

When you finish writing your reflection. Make sure you save it, then go to the app and go through the rest of the workflow to save your work to GitHub.
