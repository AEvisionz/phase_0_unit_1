# U1.W1: Your website (Solo Challenge)


## Learning Objectives
1. Wireframe a website 
2. Illustrate your understanding of web design and user experience in your website
3. Describe and practice process of building a website


## Purpose

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 1.** Please reference the <a href="https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/" target="_blank">Phase 0 Handbook</a> for more details as to what this entails. 

Regardless of whether design is interesting to you or not, web design matters to end users of the website and business management.  It's important to know about so you can work more effectively with other teams in the organization.  This process should also help you learn to separate different parts of a site (design vs. content, html vs. css, user interface vs. user experience) and learn the process of developing websites.


## Directions
 
 We're going to make your [USERNAME].github.io website truly yours.  This challenge is a chance for you to customize and make the site reflect you.  You will work on the `index.html` page through this challenge.
