W1, U1: Introduction to Chrome DevTools

##Learning Objectives
* Navigate and edit a web page's HTML and CSS elements using the inspector
* Explain what the DOM is and how it relates to CSS and HTML 
* Identify images and other page elements that cause slow performance


##Directions

In this challenge, you'll be diving into Chrome DevTools.  Inside the DevTools inspector window is an inner world of data that is communicated between the browser and server.  These tools are invaluable for you as a developer and getting comfortable with them will help optimize your HTML and CSS editing, javascript debugging, and site's performance. 

We'll be focusing primarily on real-time HTML and CSS editing in this challenge and dip our toes into using the tools to identify page elements that slow down performance and page loading.

####1) Take <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">Code School's DevTools course</a>  

Focus on chapters 1,2, and 5.  Follow along with the video, and take the quizzes at the end of each chapter (quiz 5.2 deals with JavaScript, so it is not mandatory).  You'll want to create an account with code school so you can accumulate badges and credits for the chapters you complete.  There are also exercises in the gist that will explore the concepts and tools introduced in those chapters.

Take the time to skim the other chapters.  You'll be diving into JavaScript next week, and although the material covering JS (chapters 3 and 4) is a bit advanced, it provides great exposure to JavaScript in the context of the the DevTools console.

####2) Fork the <a href="https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/0c009b8918f8b2299572" target="_blank"> Quiz</a> (like you did with your reflection) and complete it. Take a screenshot of your code school points (They appear on the right of the profile page), upload it to a public image sharing site (like min.us), and include the image in your gist.  

####3) Review and Reflect

Take a moment to reflect on all the tools presented in the tutorial.  A lot of ground was covered.  Re-explore each tab and connect the tool with its corresponding purpose.  

When you browse the web, play with the inspector. Can you use the tools to figure out why some sites are slow?  Play with the tools to tweak unsightly websites to make them more visually pleasing.
