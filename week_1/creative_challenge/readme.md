# U1.W1: Your website


## Learning Objectives
1. Understand wireframing a website
2. Personalize your website
3. Learn about web design


## Directions
 
 We're going to make your [USERNAME].github.io website truly yours.  This challenge is a chance for you to customize and make the site reflect you.  You will work on the `index.html` page through this challenge.
 
### 1) Delve into Design
 
* List of links: [Design resources for developers](https://gist.github.com/jenmyers/7354863)
* Slides: [Straight up Design](https://speakerdeck.com/jenmyers/straight-up-design)
* List of tutorials: [10 tutorials for beginning web designers](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/10-hand-picked-tutorials-for-beginning-web-designers--net-9341)
* Read: Food for thought -- [Design for performance](https://speakerdeck.com/lara/design-for-performance)

### 2) Wireframing

#### Learn

* Read: [A Beginners Guide to Wireframing](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399)

#### Apply

* Create a wireframe of your website.  You can use pen and paper or a wireframing tool.  
* Take a screenshot, photo, or save the file.  Add, commit, and push the file to Github.

### 3) Code it up

Use the wireframe as a guide to make the [USERNAME].github.io `index.html` reflect you and your current skills.

###4) Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
