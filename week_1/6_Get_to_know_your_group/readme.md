# U1.W1: Get to know your group


## Learning Objectives
1. Get to know your accountability group so you feel comfortable asking them questions and going to them for help.
2. Reflect on reflections.  Did you learn from someone's reflection? Is there something you learned that you didn't even realize before reading someone else's reflection?
3. Think about time management, productivity, and how you will get work done during this remote period.

## Purpose

Despite popular belief, most software engineers work in teams and there is a strong developer community (on the web and locally) for many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  It's important to get used to sharing with each other.


## Directions

### 1. Learn

Research time management, productivity, and mindfulness. You can try some of the articles below or find your own.  Try to read a bit outside your comfort zone though. Can you apply any of this to your situation?

### 2.  Email + Reflection

Once you've know who is in your accountability group, send everyone in your group and email **and** copy it into your [reflection gist](../reflection.md) with your:

* name
* location
* favorite websites
* learning style
* answer to: What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? How will you combat that? What techniques will you try?

Once you've completed the week's work, send them:
* link to your reflection file
* link to your [USERNAME].github.io site

Once you receive someone's reflection, take a look at it and write a comment. Make sure to take a look at your reflection gist to see other people's comments!
