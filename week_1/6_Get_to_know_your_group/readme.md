# U1.W1: Get to know your group


## Learning Objectives
1. Get to know your accountability group so you feel comfortable asking them questions and going to them for help.
2. Reflect on reflections.  Did you learn from someone's reflection? Is there something you learned that you didn't even realize before reading someone else's reflection?
3. Think about time management, productivity, and how you will get work done during this remote period.

## Purpose

Despite popular belief, most software engineers work in teams and there is a strong developer community (on the web and locally) for many technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  It's important to get used to sharing with each other.


## Directions

### 1. Intro Email

Once you know who is in your accountability group, send everyone in your group and email **and** copy it into your [reflection gist](../reflection.md) with your:

* name
* location
* favorite websites
* learning style

### 2. Share your work
Once you've completed the week's work, send them:
* link to your reflection file
* link to your [USERNAME].github.io site
* link to your wireframe html page

Once you receive someone's reflection, take a look at it and write a comment. Make sure to take a look at your reflection gist to see other people's comments!
