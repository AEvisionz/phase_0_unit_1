# Get Started

Welcome to Phase 0 Week 1! Wooohoooo! We are starting with web basics (HTML & CSS) and introducing you to Phase 0 process.

## Learning Objectives

* Set up Git and Github
* Write your first reflections
* Create your Github pages website
* Understand basic web concepts
* Push to a Github repository

## Purpose

### Why Github?

You'll be using Github every day at DBC ... and in your life as a professional developer.  It's how you will know what's going each day, find challenges to work, and collaborate with your team for your Phase 3 project.

In fact, many [people](https://twitter.com/jeresig/status/33968704983138304) in the tech industry see your [Github profile as your new resume](http://code.dblock.org/github-is-your-new-resume).

We want you to get comfortable with git and Github as soon as possible.  We are using the desktop apps for now to ease you into things, but later, we'll transition to the command line interface.

### Why the web, HTML, & CSS?

More and more [software is build on the web](http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/08/saas/).  Even desktop software often syncs with [the cloud](http://skillcrush.com/2012/04/19/the-cloud/).

Also, as a developer you'll have to switch between languages -- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, etc -- all the time.  **We're getting you comfortable with that confusion** :smiley_cat:

## Directions

Complete the challenges in the following documents in order to get everything set up to dig into HTML & CSS this week.

1. [Git and Github](git_and_github.md)
2. [Set up your website repository](set_up_repo.md)
3. [Basics of the Web](web_basics.md)

#### Navigating online slide decks

A few of the resources are online slide decks from [Girl Develop It](http://www.girldevelopit.com).  **Navigate using the arrow keys on your keyboard.** Look at the **arrow images in the bottom right** to tell you which ways you can navigate.  You may be able to go *down* as well as *left*. You can also click on links in the slides.
