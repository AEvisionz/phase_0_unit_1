## Directions

### 1. Setup git and Github

Have you signed up for <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> yet? If not, <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. Then follow <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git" target="_blank"> these instructions</a> to install git and set up SSH keys. 

#### A. Username

I'm sure you've chosen an excellent and memorable username for GitHub, so don't forget it! When you see "[USERNAME]" in this guide, replace it with your username. For example, my username is "rmw".  So "github.com/**[USERNAME]**" becomes "github.com/**rmw**".


#### B. Install the Github App

Download the Github desktop application.

- [Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

*Note: if you are using Linux, you'll need to use the command line for Git. We will have instructions for this later.*
