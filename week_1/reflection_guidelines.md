# Reflection Guidelines

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge in Phase 0. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and help your instructors gauge your progress. Reflections are for you, but they will also be read by others, so make sure to write for an audience. 

**Writing reflections for each challenge is mandatory.**

## Learning Competencies

1. Use GitHub to fork and edit gists
2. Write reflections in markdown or HTML

## Directions

#### 1. Using Sublime on your local machine, navigate to the challenge you want to submit a reflection for. Find the my_reflection.md file in the appropriate challenge folder. 

#### 2. Edit the file

You will be learning HTML this week, but these files have a `.md` extension. Do you know what that stands for? It stands for markdown, which is a text-to-HTML conversion tool.  If you would rather write in HTML, you can do that by editing the file extension (from .md to .html). 

Write your reflection (in Sublime) below the questions in the file. Make sure to write your reflections for an audience!

#### 3. Commit your changes. Then sync them to your master repo on GitHub.
