# U1.W1: Intermediate HTML & CSS



## Learning Objectives
1. Understand web standards
2. Understand responsive design


## Purpose

We think of the web and websites as mostly static. They look the way they look.  But it's really more complicated than that.  Browsers and operating systems make things look differently. Mobile came in and made everything crazy.  Web designers and developers spend a lot of time thinking about how to make web pages usabile in all the possible scenarios people use them and still keep them maintainable (i.e. not take a billion years to make a small change). The WC3 makes changes to HTML and CSS every bunch of years, so they think about how the language itself makes things easier or harder.  You should think about these things too.


## Directions

Everything in this challenge is within the context of the `unit1_week` folder in your website repository.


### 1) Web Standards & HTML5

#### a) Research

Do some research into standard practices of web design, reset css, and HTML5.

* Slides: [Structure standards and HTML5](http://girldevelopit.com/assets/intermediate-html-css/class1.html#/17)


#### b) Apply
Download the [practice files](http://girldevelopit.com/assets/intermediate-html-css/class1.zip).  Unzip the folder into your `unit1_week1` folder.

* Add reset.css to your index.html file. What happens?
* Update the header links to jump to sections
* Make links change color on hover
* Change the font (@fontface) for elements on the site.
* Change some elements to semantic HTML5 elements (i.e. header, section, etc)

#### c) Reflect

Answer the following questions in your [reflection](../reflection.md):
* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?



### 2) Responsive Web Design

#### a) Research

Look into responsive web design.  What is it? Why is it used?

* Slides: [Introduction to Responsive Web Design and Compatability](http://girldevelopit.com/assets/intermediate-html-css/class4.html#/4/2)
* Read: [Beginners guide to responsive web design](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-to-responsive-web-design)
* Make: [Treehouse: Build a Responsive Website](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-responsive-website)
* Slides: [Web Accessibility](http://girldevelopit.com/assets/web-accessibility/index.html)
* Read: [Change your browsers user agent](http://osxdaily.com/2013/01/16/change-user-agent-chrome-safari-firefox/)


#### b) Apply

Using either a new html page in the `unit1_week1` folder or [practice files](http://girldevelopit.com/assets/intermediate-html-css/class4.zip) unzipped into the `unit1_week1` folder, try to make your page more responsive.  

How does it look when
* on your phone 
* on a tablet
* on really wide screen
* resized really small
* the user agent is changed in your browser

#### c) Reflect

Answer the following questions in your [reflection](../reflection.md):
* Do you like responsive web design?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have really resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
