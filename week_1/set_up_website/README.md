# Set up your website

You'll be using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to set your website.

[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) use a Ruby ["gem"](http://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/) (or collection of Ruby files) called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) to create your website.



## Github Setup

Have you signed up for [Github](http://www.github.com) yet? If not, [sign up here](https://github.com/).

You'll need to [install git and set up SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) (authentication for Github).  [Follow this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

### Your Username

You need to know your Github username.  When you see "[USERNAME]" in this guide, you'll replace it with your username.

My username is "rmw".  So "github.com/**[USERNAME]**" becomes "github.com/**rmw**".

### The Github App

Download the Github desktop application.

- [Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

*Note: if you are using Linux, you'll need to use the command line for Git.*
