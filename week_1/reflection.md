# Week 1 Reflection

This is the spot for your week 1 reflections.  Answer the questions listed in your reflection.

**For each section, write your reflection below the list of questions.    You should complete ALL reflections by the end of the week.**

You are welcome to also reflect more broadly on your learning process, how you learn, and any other concepts, resources, techniques, or 'AHA' moments.

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking.

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

**Email your accoutability group a link to this file and comment on each other's reflections.**
