# U1.W1: Your Favorite Websites


## Learning Objectives
1. Evaluate a website in terms of design and user experience
2. Compare websites to discuss what they are doing well and what they can improve on
3. Read a website's HTML and CSS 
4. Determine whether a website is following best practices

## Purpose
In the same way that professors and graduate students are required to contribute through publications, developers are expected to make contributions to their field. In Phase 0, you will start your contributions through blogging about cultural and technical topics that correspond to the week's topics. 

## Directions

Identify three of your favorite websites. What do you like about them? How is the navigation? What is the user experience like?

In a blog post, evaluate these websites in terms of their user experience and design. Do not feel like you need to only focus on good parts. If you are critical of some parts, identify what those are and why you don't like them as much. Also compare the websites to one another.  

As a bonus, get more technical. Take a look at the websites' HTML by opening the devloper tools. Does the HTML look clean? Does it follow good practices? (If you want help with this, try googling for HTML/CSS best practices to read up on various people's ideas.)
