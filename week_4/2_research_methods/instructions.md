# U1.W1: Researching methods to find matches


## Learning Objectives
1. Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges
2. Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
3. Explain 


## Directions

This is the process you should complete every time you work on a challenge. First read, then create pseudocode, write a solution, make it pass the tests, refactor the code, then reflect. 

In this challenge, you will need to research built-in ruby methods to find and manipulate matches. You will need to spend time reading the ruby docs and investigating exactly how they work in IRB. 

###1) Pseudocode
Read the method calls and expected output. What is the input (what is going into the method) and output (what should the code return?). Do you want to manipulate the original structure? Do you want to return a copy with the results? Summarize what the method needs to do. Read through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/" target="_blank">Ruby Docs</a> and see if you can find methods that will do this for you. Make a note of the promising methods.



###2) Initial Solution

Try implementing the methods you made a note of in IRB. Are the methods modifying the original structure? Are they returning a new object? How can you use IRB to investigate this? 

When you have a solution that uses the method to get the expected output, include that code in your `research_methods.rb` file. Make sure to run it to make sure it's working using your terminal. 
Include a comment under each solution that describes how the method is working. What does it do? What kinds of input can it take? What kind of structure does it return? Make sure you can explain exactly how the method works.


<!--###4) Review and Create Tests
Click on the "See Specs" button in the exercise, and review the rspec tests that you just passed. 
-->
###3) Refactored Solution
Read through your solutions. Are all of your names clear? Is the code concise (but readable)? Are you repeating yourself? Are all of your variables necessary? Take some time with the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/" target="_blank">Ruby Docs</a>  

Remember: great code is rarely the fewest number of characters or lines, it's about how readable, extendable, and reusable it is.

If you can't figure out how to refactor your initial solution, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank, you need to justify your omission.

###4) Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or Ruby tricks?
* Did you learn any new `enumerable` methods? We sure hope so!

###5) Review (We need a better way for students to review other's code!)

Look through at least 3 people's solutions. Did you use the same methods? Compare your explanation to the other students. Were your explanations different? Do you have any questions about how the method works after reading their solutions?
