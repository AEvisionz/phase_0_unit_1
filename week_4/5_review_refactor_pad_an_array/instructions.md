Here's your opportunity to deepen your understanding of coding principles. In this challenge, you'll review some of your cohort members solutions to  [Create a Method to Pad an Array](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/421); then do it again with your new knowledge. 

### Learning Goals 

* Reading and understanding another code base 
* Recognizing good code
* Refactoring code
* Distilling coding practices

### Objectives

### 1) Review Others
* Go review the solutions to [Create a Method to Pad an Array](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/421), under "Recent Attempts." 
* Skim solutions submitted by your fellow students. 
* Choose 2 or 3 code examples that were particularly interesting.
* Publish a comment (in Github) under the solution reviewing readability, code style, performance, DRYness, and general code quality.  
* Tell the author why you chose their code.

### 2) Refactor Yours
Refactor your initial solution to the challenge make sure you:

* Implement new tricks you learned.
* **Make inline comments explaining your additions!** (How does this code work?  Why did you add it? What coding practice does it exemplify?)  
* Add inline comments which very clearly label what challenge you are refactoring. include a link at the top to the challenge, reviewed solution, and your initial solution for easy reference.
* Submit your refactored code in the solution gist above.  


### 3) Focus your comments and refactoring on the topics of the week!
* Proper Variable Naming - make the variable name descriptive and concise  
     - don't name after the data structure  
     - avoid numbered variables (var1, var2, var3)  
     - avoid single character names 
* Proper Method Naming  
     - the name should reflect the method's single responsibility  
* Keep it DRY  
     - condense repetitive code  
     - create methods to encapsulate common functions  

### 4) Pass the RSpec tests
* Make sure your newly refactored code actually works.  You should see all green for the tests.

###5) Reflect
Reflect on your process and understanding.  Include your reflections as comments in your solution.  

* What is the correct terminology to describe any new tricks you learned?  
* Think about how you initially solved the challenge. How did you miss these tricks?  How could you approach future challenges differently and improve your understanding and code quality?  

**Keep in mind:** Your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well.  Be generous with your reflections!  You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.
