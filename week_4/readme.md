# Back to Ruby!

So you've done some preparation on Ruby, and have probably been wondering "Why did they have us do all those exercises if we weren't even going to start with Ruby?" Well, now is your time to dive back into ruby. We hope you enjoyed your brief affair with web applications and will work to continue to practice your HTML and CSS skills in your blog assignments. 

This week you will be working on creating some command-line programs. Some challenges will also have tests already developed using RSpec (a tool for testing ruby code). You will learn how to run these tests on your computer and read them to figure out what the errors are. NOTE: You are not expected to write RSpec in Phase 0, just read it. RSpec is designed to be readable. 

## Before you begin:
[Install RSpec](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby-for-newbies-testing-with-rspec--net-21297)


## Challenges
1. [Calculate an Array's total]()
2. [Calculate the Letter Grade]()
3. [Research Methods]()
4. [Calculate the Median - SC]()
5. [Pad an Array]()
6. [Review and Refactor: Pad an Array]()
7. [Technical Blog]()
8. [Cultural Blog]()
9. [GPS 1.2]()
9. [BONUS: Calculate the Mode]()


## Submitting your work
Instead of using gists this week, you will be storing your work in a repository. 
- Fork [this repository](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/p0_unit1_submission). At the top right, click "Fork." 
- Under settings (in the right navigation bar) check the box next to "issues" under "features." This will allow people
  to give you feedback.
- Open your GitHub desktop app. Find the `p0_unit1_submission` repository and click "clone to computer." 

When you make updates to the files, you should commit your work the same way you did for your website through the app.

You need to submit your work through [this google form]() by Sunday at 11:59pm. Expect to submit the links from your repo for each challenge above.
