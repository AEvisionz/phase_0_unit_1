# U1.W1: Calculate the Array Total


## Learning Objectives
1. Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
2. Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges
<!-- 3. Use if/else statements, regular expressions, string methods, while/until loops,  Enumerable#each methods -->


## Directions

Make sure you have already completed [How to Submit A Challenge](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/417) before starting this challenge.

This is the process you should complete every time you work on a challenge. First read, then create pseudocode, write a solution, make it pass the tests, refactor the code, then reflect 

Click the "Start" button above to open the gist AND go the exercise: <a href="http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/exercises/26" target="_blank">EXERCISE: Calculating the Array Total</a>

NOTE: Make sure everything that is not code is included as a comment. You should be able to run your gist file in your terminal with no errors.  

###1) Pseudocode
Define the input (what is going into the method) and output (what should the code return?).  Then list out the steps to solve the problem.  Write these in plain english and save them to your gist as comments. 

*NOTE: Make sure your pseudocode is broken down to easily implementable steps.*

###2) Initial Solution
Turn your pseudocode into code by translating each step into code. If your pseudocode is not easy to implement, modify it, and re-attempt to code it. 

When you have code that successfully turns the input into your expected output paste your code in the exercise box and see if it passes Socrates RSpec tests.  

If your code passes, copy the initial code into the gist. If it doesn't pass every test, read the failing tests, and modify your solution to pass each. (If you don't know where the problem is, try using `puts  ` statements into your code to see if it's doing everything you expect it to). Once you have passed all the tests, save your initial code in your gist.


<!--###4) Review and Create Tests
Click on the "See Specs" button in the exercise, and review the rspec tests that you just passed. 
-->
###3) Refactored Solution
Read through your solution. Are the names clear? Is the code concise (but readable)? Are you repeating yourself? Are all of your variables necessary? Take some time with the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/" target="_blank">Ruby Docs</a> to see if any existing methods can replace any of your code. Modify anything that's not clear, delete what is unnecessary, and use ruby methods to make your solution more expandable and readable. 

Remember: great code is rarely the fewest number of characters or lines, it's about how readable, extendable, and reusable it is.

After refactoring, make sure your code still passes all of the Socrates RSpec tests. Paste your code in the refactor section.

If you can't figure out how to refactor your initial solution, write why you think it's great instead. Do not simply copy the initial solution or leave this section blank, you need to justify your omission.

###4) Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Also, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or Ruby tricks?
* Did you learn any new `enumerable` methods?

###5) Review

After you submit your challenge, click on the "[Review and Reflect](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/435#review_and_reflect)" tab at the top of the challenge next to "Recent Attempts."  Read through this to explore an optimized solution for this problem.

Remember:  The "Recent Attempts" page has a wealth of knowledge.  Review other solutions to pick up new insights.  And remember that when you submit a solution, you have the opportunity to explain things to a fellow student.  Be generous!
