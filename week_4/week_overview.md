# Week 1: Ruby Methods and Data Structures


### By the end of week 1, you should be able to:
- [ ] Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content   
- [ ] Differentiate between and produce destructive and non-destructive methods  
- [ ] Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges  
- [ ] Analyze a challenge and determine which data structure (arrays or hashes) to use based on the requirements  
- [ ] Feel confident using strings, integers, arrays, and hashes

### Assignments and Challenges:

#### Assignments
- [ ] Watch [Engineering Empathy: EQ & Feedback](https://vimeo.com/76762772) - *To be done before end of day Tuesday*   
- [ ] Watch [Pairing is Caring](https://vimeo.com/76662569) - *To be done before your first pairing session*

*For each challenge:*

1. Formulate pseudocode before solving the problem (include it as a comment).  
2. Refactor each solution so the names are clear and the code is concise and D.R.Y. (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). Ensure your code still passes the RSpec tests by resubmitting it with your changes. [REFERENCE: Introduction to Refactoring] (http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/introduction-to-refactoring)  
3. Reflect on your process and understanding (see section below). Include your reflection as comments in your solution.
