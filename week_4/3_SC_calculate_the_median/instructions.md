## Solo Challenge (Unit 1, Week 1)
Take your time to see what concepts you feel comfortable and confident with. You are welcome to conduct research online, but make sure your code represents your own work. Please refrain from asking others for help.

##Overview

1. Click the "Start" button above to go the exercise: <a href="http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/exercises/16" target="_blank">EXERCISE: Calculating the Median</a>

2. Follow the objectives below and update your gist for each one.  Use "Edit this gist" link that appeared after you clicked the "Start" button.

##Objectives

###1) Create Pseudocode
Define the input.  Define the output.  Then list out the steps to solve the problem.  Write these in plain english and save them to your gist as comments.

###2) Pass The Tests
Go to the exercise above and pass the tests.  When you see all green, copy your initial code into your gist and save it under "Initial Code."

###3) Refactor Your Code
Refactor your solution so the names are clear and the code is concise and D.R.Y. (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). Ensure your code still passes the RSpec tests by resubmitting it with your changes. 

[REFERENCE: Introduction to Refactoring] (http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/introduction-to-refactoring)  

###4) Reflect
Reflect on your process and understanding (see the Reflection Questions included below and at the bottom of the gist). Include your reflections as comments in your solution.  

**Keep in mind:** Your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well.  Be generous with your reflections!  You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

###5) BONUS: Review the Rspec
You've probably already noticed that the exercises in Socrates have tests in Rspec, a testing language for ruby.  Go ahead and click on "Show Specs" for this exercise (linked to in the Overview).  If you're new to Rspec, learn about it with this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj19O9kLK6w).

Can you decipher what the Rspec is doing?  If you're ready for a bit more of a challenge, create a ruby translation of the rspec tests and include them in your gist.  (Some Rspec tests are particularly tricky to do in ruby, so do the ones that you can and we'll get more into translating them next week.)

###6) Submit the Challenge
Don't forget to click "Submit" above!  It should include all 4 components: (Pseudocode, Initial code,  Refactored code, Review/Reflections).

####Reflection Guidelines
Reflection is vital to learning and growth. These challenges should not be thought of as items to check off; they are your opportunities to learn and grow as a programmer. Be mindful of each of the following questions after solving each challenge:   

* Was your strategy for solving the challenge successful?    
* What part of your strategy worked? What parts were challenging?  
* What questions did you have while coding? Did you find answers to them?  
* Are there any concepts that are still confusing to you?  
* Did you learn any new skills or Ruby tricks?
